There is a limit to which a Resume can potray. Resume lacks the emotion behind the work one does, it misses out on the actual code, the insight behind the project and demo's and so much more. Creating this Website gives me the platform to show my work, the inspiration behind the projects and the outcome that came of it. I will delligently build on it, as I progress in my journey of a Data Scientist and will share my work and finding's with whoever comes accross this website. Thank you for taking the time to explore.
